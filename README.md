# Stanford_ML
My coursework from Coursera's Stanford Machine Learning course taught by Professor Andrew Ng.

The files here are from exercises/assignments and projects that are required. Optional exercises were not incorporated here unless otherwise specified for the sake of time. 

**Exercise 1: Week 2**
This is the introductory assignment for learning how to utilize MATLAB and simple linear regression. Questions 1 and 2 were assigned as required. Questions 3 and 4 files were not incorporated into the folder on the date of October, 24, 2020 due to time constraints.

**Exercise 2: Week 3**
This week's programming assignment was to utilize the conceptual knowledge taught behind Logistics Regression and Regularization. The full solutions file was inputted into a pdf file into the github folder.
